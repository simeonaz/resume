# resume

This project is the source code of my resume, written with Vue 3, HTML, and Tailwind CSS.

Each page of my resume is a Vue component. To download my resume as a PDF, I use the [tailwindpdf](https://tailwindpdf.com/) platform, which allows me to select the div from each page/component and download it as a PDF file.

To view the French version of the resume, go to the `/fr` route.
